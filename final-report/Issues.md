Issues

We encountered many issues along the way as we tried to pursue our original goal using the tools available to us.  We encountered trouble trying to display messages using MicroPython because the library was not specifically designed for the OLED display that we chose to use.  This set us back in our schedule, because we had planned to use a pre-constructed library to handle communication between our board and display.  However, we were able to modify the MicroPython library to create the functions we needed.

Another major problem we had came with trying to use Adafruit IO as a broker to send messages to the board over MQTT.  We consistently had problems with connectivity, and often wouldn't be able to connect to the MQTT broker, meaning that messages uploaded to Adafruit IO would not be picked up by the board because it would not be consistently "subscribed" to the feed, or the umqtt.simple library `check_msg()` function would return empty handed.  To fix this, we decided to use the API function provided by Adafruit IO instead of MQTT.  This ensured that we could always pick up the most recent message posted to the Adafruit IO page without worrying about whether or not the connection had dropped.

A third issue occurred while implementing the countdownTimer() function.  We originally had the function contained in a separate script, like all of the other data functions (i.e.  get_stocks.py, get_weather.py, etc.).  However, we could not debug a "variable called before reference" error that seemed to come from a call to a function we were importing from another script.  To resolve this error, we put the body of the countdownTimer.py function into the main.py script and no longer had to import anything.  The function then worked, but it makes our main.py much more clunky, and does not really belong there.
