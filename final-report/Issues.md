Issues

We encountered many issues along the way as we tried to pursue our original goal using the tools available to us.  We encountered trouble trying to display messages using MicroPython because the library was not specifically designed for the OLED display that we chose to use.  This set us back in our schedule, because we had planned to use a pre-constructed library to handle communication between our board and display.  However, we were able to modify the MicroPython library to create the functions we needed.

Another major problem we had came with trying to use Adafruit IO as a broker to send messages to the board over MQTT.  We consistently had problems with connectivity, and often wouldn't be able to connect to the MQTT broker, meaning that messages uploaded to Adafruit IO would not be picked up by the board because it would not be consistently "subscribed" to the feed, or the umqtt.simple library `check_msg()` function would return empty handed.  To fix this, we decided to use the API function provided by Adafruit IO instead of MQTT.  This ensured that we could always pick up the most recent message posted to the Adafruit IO page without worrying about whether or not the connection had dropped.

A third issue occurred while implementing the countdownTimer() function.  We originally had the function contained in a separate script, like all of the other data functions (i.e.  get_stocks.py, get_weather.py, etc.).  However, we struggled to 'port over' our button-press ISRs, from our main script to the kitchen_timer script.  The Timer uses flags in order to navigate the user about (e.g. if the user presses B, start the timer, but only if the timer hasn't been started yet, etc.).  When we tried to isolate the Timer functions, and call them from main, we were no longer able to have access to our flags from inside of these, as the ISRs were defined in main.py. To resolve this issue, we put the body of the countdown function into the main.py script and no longer had to import anything.  The function then worked, but the timer code renders our main.py heftier and more clunky (it is already complexe enough), and does not really belong there
