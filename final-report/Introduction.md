Introduction

Our goal for this project was to create a refrigerator magnet that modeled the functionalities of a
modern "smart fridge."  After both living in large group homes this semester (Meeker and Homestead), we have come to realize the social importance of the refrigerator as a central gathering place and frequently visited location for almost all members of the house.  For this reason, we decided that it would be highly practical and useful to create a way to give people access to important information, as well as creating a way for house members to leave messages that the rest of the house is likely to see.  The functions we initially planned to include in the device were:

-Current time
-Weather
-Stock values of various companies
-Kitchen timer
-Custom message display (i.e. a house member uploads a message from their phone)

We were excited to move from the projects we had been working on in class, using lower level 
programming in Arduino for the CircuitPlayground, to using Python on the ESP32.  The combination of a more powerful board and higher level language, we hoped, would allow us to achieve more ambitious goals with this project than we could have at the start of the semester.  It felt as though, after learning how the board interacted with its own memory and the peripherals attached to it, we were ready to abstract away some of the more technical details without getting too lost when we needed to cut through those abstractions to deal directly with the board.  In that sense, we hoped to use the control we learned in C, with the computing power of Python.
